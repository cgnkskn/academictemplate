<p style="font-size: 18px;">I am a Ph.D. candidate at CERGE-EI (Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education—Economics Institute), a joint workplace of Charles University and the Czech Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">My research interest lies in endogenous growth theory, firm dynamics, networks, and applied econometrics.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Over the past decades, intangible assets have increased sharply. This paper aims to understand how the heterogeneity of intangible assets affects firms’ investment decisions across different sizes, focusing on growth, span of control, and spillover effects. I distinguish between two types of intangible assets: transferable (R&D) and embedded (brand value and organizational capital), each influencing business dynamics differently. The results indicate that firms with fewer production lines invest more in transferable intangible assets, while firms with many production lines prioritize embedded intangible assets. In the long run, embedded intangible assets have a level effect rather than a growth effect on output, whereas transferable intangible assets affect both transitional and long-run periods. While markups increase with both types of intangible assets, the markup and profit per production line decrease due to the span of control. Furthermore, the non-transferable nature of embedded intangible assets leads to reduced spillover effects in larger firms, driven by their higher investment in these assets.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">We examine the production network effects of domestic vs. foreign acquisitions of Turkish firms. Following foreign (but not domestic) acquisitions, we observe an erosion of the acquired firms’ markup, that is compensated by increased markups of those firms’ upstream sellers.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Abstract.</strong> We study the long-run effects of historical place-based policies targeting R&D: the creation of <em>Science Cities</em> in former Soviet Russia. The establishment of Science Cities and the criteria for selecting their location were largely guided by military and strategic considerations. We compare current demographic and economic characteristics of Science Cities with those of appropriately matched localities that were similar to them at the time of their establishment, and had similar pre-trends. We find that in present-day Russia, despite the massive cuts in government support to R&D that followed the dissolution of the USSR, Science Cities still host more highly skilled workers and more developed R&D and ICT sectors; they are the origin of more international patents; and they generally appear to be more productive and economically developed. We also rule out alternative explanations related to the differential use of public resources, and we find limited evidence of reversion to the mean. By estimating a spatial equilibrium model in our matched sample, we interpret these findings as the result of the interaction between persistence and agglomeration forces.</p>
