<p style="font-size: 18px;">I am a Ph.D. candidate at CERGE-EI (Center for Economic Research and Graduate Educationâ€”Economics Institute), a joint workplace of Charles University and the Czech Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">My research interest lies in endogenous growth theory, firm dynamics, networks, and applied econometrics.</p>

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 1em 0;">
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Abstract.</strong> Over the past decades, intangible assets have increased sharply. This paper aims to understand how the heterogeneity of intangible assets affects firms' investment decisions across different sizes, focusing on growth, span of control, and spillover effects. I distinguish between two types of intangible assets: transferable (R&D) and embedded (brand value and organizational capital), each influencing business dynamics differently. The results indicate that firms with fewer production lines invest more in transferable intangible assets, while firms with many production lines prioritize embedded intangible assets. In the long run, embedded intangible assets have a level effect rather than a growth effect on output, whereas transferable intangible assets affect both transitional and long-run periods. While markups increase with both types of intangible assets, the markup and profit per production line decrease due to the span of control. Furthermore, the non-transferable nature of embedded intangible assets leads to reduced spillover effects in larger firms, driven by their higher investment in these assets.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Abstract.</strong> We examine the production network effects of domestic vs. foreign acquisitions of Turkish firms. Following foreign (not domestic) acquisitions, we observe an erosion of the acquired firms' markup that is compensated by increased markups of those firms' upstream sellers.</p>
